Condor is a simple PHP framework.
Very simple.

To get it working you gotta change the base routes in two places:
index.php
.htaccess

It's pretty obvious.

Make controllers for your stuff. There are a few already, so you can see how it hooks together.

Add a flash message in a controller method like this:
sys()->flash->|name| = |str|;

Where |name| is anything (notice, error) and |str| is your error messages or whatever. It's all very exciting.
I got some CSS to make this blingier, but you can just try it and see what it makes and whatever yourself.

This isn't done yet, so don't come crying to me if you download it and it maxes out your credit cards or kills your rabbit or something.
